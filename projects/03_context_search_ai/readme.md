# ContextIQ - Intelligent Contextual Search Agent

## Overview
ContextIQ is an intelligent search agent that leverages information from multiple sources, including Tavily and Wikipedia, to provide accurate, context-driven answers using Large Language Models (LLMs). This project utilizes LangGraph to dynamically fetch and structure information, allowing users to access comprehensive and precise responses from diverse web sources.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Information Retrieval with LangGraph**: Integrates data from Tavily and Wikipedia, aggregating relevant context to support detailed and reliable responses.
- **Dynamic Context Handling**: Incorporates state management and contextual data to enhance response relevance based on user queries.
- **Response Generation with LLMs**: Uses Large Language Models to analyze and synthesize information from retrieved contexts, providing a coherent and accurate answer to complex questions.

## Customization

- **Flexible and Extendable Design**: This base project can be customized with additional sources and LLM APIs to enhance the agentâ€™s functionality. Users can modify the LangGraph configuration to fit specific use cases, making it adaptable to various domains and topics.
