## Overview
The **Chatbot with Summarizing Messages and Memory** project aims to create an intelligent conversational agent that can effectively engage users while summarizing conversations and maintaining context over multiple interactions. Leveraging LangGraph, this chatbot enhances user experience by retaining key information and generating concise summaries of prior exchanges.

## Features
- **Dynamic Message Summarization**: The chatbot automatically summarizes conversations, enabling users to quickly catch up on previous interactions without sifting through all messages.
- **Memory Management**: Implements a memory system that allows the chatbot to remember user-specific details across sessions, facilitating a personalized experience.
- **State Management**: Utilizes structured state management to keep track of conversation history, user preferences, and summarization state.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Employs advanced NLP techniques to interpret user input and generate coherent, context-aware responses.

## Customization
- **Flexible Architecture**: The design of this project is modular, allowing developers to easily extend or modify its capabilities. Additional features such as custom summarization logic or integration with other LLM APIs can be implemented to enhance the chatbot's functionality.
