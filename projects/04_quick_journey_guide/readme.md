# QuickJourneyGuide

## Overview
**QuickJourneyGuide** is a travel planning project built using **LangGraph**, designed to simplify and personalize travel experiences. The tool leverages a language model (LLM) to create a custom itinerary based on user inputs, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable travel planning process.

## Features
- **Personalized Itineraries**: Generate detailed travel plans tailored to user-provided information, including the city to visit, number of days, number of persons, and specific interests.
- **AI-Powered Flexibility**: Harness the power of LLMs to recommend activities, dining options, and sightseeing spots.
- **Dynamic Inputs**:
  - **City Selection**: Specify the city you wish to visit.
  - **Trip Duration**: Enter the number of days for the trip.
  - **Group Size**: Provide the number of persons.
  - **User Interests**: Share your preferences to get a highly personalized itinerary.

## Built With
- **LangGraph**: A framework for building modular AI workflows, enabling efficient handling of multi-step processes using a graph-based structure.

## Practical Application
**QuickJourneyGuide** demonstrates how to construct an intelligent and extendable travel planning system by combining LangGraph with LLMs. It serves as an excellent example for building more complex AI agent architectures in other domains.

## Extendable with LLM APIs
This project is easily extendable, allowing the integration of additional LLM APIs to further enhance and customize its capabilities.
